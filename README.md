### This planner app allows the user to input tasks to hourly positions from 9am to 5pm for the current day. When the text box is clicked, the user can input a task, then click the save button to save that task. Given that task is in the future, it will save, if the task is in the past it will not save to localStorage. The past, present, and future is color coded to indicated time.
